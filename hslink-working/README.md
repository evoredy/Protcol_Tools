# Welcome to the story of HS/Link v0.0.1a

HS/Link is an error correcting bidirecitonal protocol designed to work over noisy telephone lines to facilitate file transfers. During a file transfer, users could conduct two-way chatting along with other diagnostic features while maintaining speeds at the phyical limit of the link. The code is optimized for x86 PCs of the time with their limited memory capabilties and storage so basically it's very light-- less than 40K compiled specifially.

I see lots of use cases today. Let's revive this.

Final message about this software from the author Samuel H. Smith:
```

I am the author of the HS/Link file transfer protocol
As many of you know, last year my offices were burglarized and my main software development system stolen, complete with latest backup tapes.

As a result, I have no source code at all for the windows dlp version of hs/link, and only a 2/94 edition of the dos version. This loss really took all the steam out of my development plans for this project. Please don't send registrations for hs/link- I'm no longer picking up mail at my Panorama City PO box.  Consider this program "free" and unsupported.

To "register" the DOS version of HS/Link, type:
    hslink register 999 x8ib2p

Use this information to register the Windows DL version:
    Registration number: 999
    Activation code: a00xi8b2p

I am posting what source code I could dig up, in the hopes that others may eventually benefit from my past work, and to keep the protocol alive, at least in some changed form.

The source code is contained in the file 121B7SC.ZIP.
You can get it from from my FTP directory
    ftp://ftp.primenet.com/users/s/shsmith/hslink

	
I operate a bulletin board system, The Tool Shop.
